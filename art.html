                        <p>The “Adventures of Art Son of Conn” can seem fairly confusing at first glance, with all
                            the foreign names and places, but with a little context, the story seems to fit into a normal Irish
                            kingship story. The story begins by introducing our main hero Art, telling us all of his ancestors.
                            This is very common in Irish text as Irish people are named after their ancestors to give their
                            lineage credibility. Like most Irish kingship stories, the first person we are truly introduced to in
                            depth is a parent of the main hero, that parent being Conn King of Tara, or Ireland.</p>
                            <p>Conn becomes an unfit king when he marries the trickster Becuma Cneisgel, banishing
                            his son unjustly by her command. In Ireland, Kingship requires the king have fir flathemon,
                            which means the “truth of a prince”. If you make unjust decisions, you become unfit to rule and
                            Ireland loses its prosperity. This is also shown when Conn’s new wife pushes for him to murder
                            the sinless boy, Segda Saerlabraid, to bring back prosperity to Ireland. Really, if he divorced her,
                            prosperity would return to his rule. Luckily, Segda’s mother was there to save him, and Conn
                            realized Becuma was dangerous, however he could not divorce her. But somehow, they would
                            have to find a way of ridding Tara of her siege.</p>
                            <p>We then begin the competition between Art and Becuma, who are now enemies. Becuma,
                            who we can tell is otherworldly, attempts to put a geis on Art, or a rule that cannot be broken
                            without dire consequences, unless he plays a game of chess with her. He plays and wins, and so
                            starts the competition of who can get rid of who. Because he won, Art puts a geis on Becuma that she may not eat while in the lands of Tara until she retrieves Cu Roi mac Dairi’s wand for
                            him. She starts her search by visiting Tara’s sid, or fairy mounds which are entrances to the other
                            world, and eventually meets a foster sister at one. The foster sister gives her directions on how to
                            find the wand, and with some difficulty she eventually completes her geis. When Becuma returns
                            to Tara, she places a geis upon Art as penance, sending him off to the other world to find
                            Delbchaem daughter of Morgan and bring her back to Tara. Delbchaem could only be found in
                            the land of Wonders, which meant Art had to leave Tara and venture to the otherworld to find
                            this mysterious woman.</p>
                            <p>This part of the story begins to become a wooing tale, known in Irish as a Tochmarc. A
                            Tochmarc is a tale in which a young king or hero seeks out a woman he has only heard of to
                            make her his wife. Art begins his journey by going though a series of ordeals involving
                            poisonous frogs, “perverse hags”, and few other nature events until he comes to his first battle.
                            He fights two men to gain information on Delbchaem’s whereabouts, and eventually finds her.
                            The only problem is, her parents are unwilling to part with her. This is a common motif in
                            Tochmarcs, where parents give suitors impossible tasks to try and dissuaded the man from
                            pursuing the woman. In this story, Delbchaem’s mother, Coinchenn Cennfada, is a warrior
                            woman and challenges Art to fight her for her daughter. Art obliges, and kills Coinchenn, which
                            causes Morgan, Delbchaem’s father, to avenge his wife, and eventually be killed by Art too. Art
                            then takes a wooed Debchaem, who was finally free of her overbearing parents, back to Tara.
                            With this feat completed, Art banishes Becuma from Tara, and everyone lived happily ever after.</p>
